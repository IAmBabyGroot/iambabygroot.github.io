# **What is Markdown?**
[Markdown](www.example.com) is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

*Gists
*Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
*Files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extension
For more information, see “[Writing on GitHub](www.example.com)” in the *GitHub Help*.
